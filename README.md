```

2. Navigate to the `OpenAIChatGPTBlazor` folder:

```
cd OpenAIChatGPTBlazor

## Configuration

### Local Configuration

To use a local configuration, add user secrets with the following content:

```json
{
  "OpenAI": {
    "ResourceName": "oai-myendpoint-eus",
    "DeploymentId": "gpt-35-turbo",
    "ApiKey": "xxx" // remove to use AAD auth
  },
}
```

Provide your OpenAI API Key in the `ApiKey` field, or remove the field to use AAD authentication.

### Azure App Configuration

To use a Azure App Configuration, add user secrets with the following content:

```json
{
  "AppConfig": {
    "Endpoint": "https://appcs-myinstance-weu.azconfig.io"
  }
}
```

Replace the `Endpoint` value with the URL of your Azure App Configuration instance. This is using AAD authentication.

## Usage

After configuring and running the application, open a web browser and navigate to `https://localhost:7128`. You should be able to use the chat interface to communicate with the GPT-3.5 Turbo model and generate human-like text.
